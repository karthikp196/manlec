  <h1 class="term_1">Terms of Trade</h1>
    <div class="terms">
     <ul  >
        <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Definitions</h4>
        <li >“MANLEC” means ‘MANIX TRUST’ trading as ‘MANLEC’ (ABN 58 638 746 165 ) by its successors assigns or any person acting on behalf of and with the authority of MANLEC</li>
            <li>“Customer” means the person/s buying the ‘Electrical’, ‘Goods’ or ‘Services’ as specified in any invoice, document/contract or order, and if there is more than one Customer is a reference to each Customer jointly and severally.</li>
            <li> “Electrical” means all ‘Works’, ‘Labour’, ‘Goods’, ‘Materials’, or ‘Services’, supplied by MANLEC to the Customer at the Customer’s request from time to time (where the context so permits the terms ‘Electrical’,  ‘Labour’, ‘Goods’, ‘Materials’, ‘Works’, or ‘Services’, shall be interchangeable for each other). </li>
            <li> “Price” means the Price payable for the ‘Electrical’ as agreed between MANLEC and the Customer in accordance with clause 4. </li>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Acceptance</h4>
            <li> The Customer is taken to have exclusively accepted and is immediately bound, jointly and severally, by these terms and conditions if the Customer places an order for or accepts delivery of any Works or Goods. </li>
            <li> These terms and conditions may only be amended with MANLEC consent in writing and shall prevail to the extent of any inconsistency with any other document or agreement between the Customer and MANLEC. </li>
            <li> The Customer accepts and acknowledges that a call out fee applies.  Such call out fee shall be: </li>
            <li> equal to one (1) hour’s labour at MANLEC standard hourly labour rate (and includes up to one (1) hour of labour) for attendance during business hours; or </li>
            <li> equal to two (2) hours’ labour at MANLEC after hours’ labour rate (and includes up to two (2) hours labour) for attendance after hours. </li>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Change in Control</h4>
            <li> The Customer shall give MANLEC not less than fourteen (14) days prior written notice of any proposed change of ownership of the Customer and/or any other change in the Customer’s details (including but not limited to, changes in the Customer’s name, address, contact phone or fax number/s, or business practice). </li>
            <li> The Customer shall be liable for any loss incurred by MANLEC as a result of the Customer’s failure to comply with this clause. </li>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Price and Payment</h4>
            <li > At MANLEC sole discretion the Price shall be either:</li>
            <ol>
            <li > as indicated on any invoice provided by MANLEC  to the Customer; or</li>
            <li> the Price as at the date of delivery of the Goods according to MANLEC current price list; or </li>
            <li> MANLEC quoted price (subject to clause 5.2) which will be valid for the period stated in the quotation or otherwise for a period of thirty (30) days. </li>
            </ol>
            <li> MANLEC reserves the right to change the Price if a variation to MANLEC’ quotation is requested. Payment for all variations must be made in full at their time of completion. </li>
            <li>At MANLEC’ sole discretion a non-refundable deposit may be required.</li>
            <li> Time for payment for the Goods being of the essence, the Price will be payable by the Customer on the date/s determined by MANLEC, which may be: </li>
           <ol>
            <li> on delivery of the Goods;</li>
            <li> before delivery of the Goods; </li>
            <li> the date specified on any invoice or other form as being the date for payment; or </li>
            <li> failing any notice to the contrary, the date which is fourteen (14) days following the date of any invoice given to the Customer by MANLEC. </li>
          </ol>
          <li>Payment may be made by cash, cheque, bank cheque, electronic/on-line banking, or by any other method as agreed to between the Customer and MANLEC.</li>
          <li> Unless otherwise stated the Price does not include GST. In addition to the Price the Customer must pay to MANLEC an amount equal to any GST MANLEC must pay for any supply by MANLEC under this or any other agreement for the sale of the Goods. The Customer must pay GST, without deduction or set off of any other amounts, at the same time and on the same basis as the Customer pays the Price. In addition the Customer must pay any other taxes and duties that may be applicable in addition to the Price except where they are expressly included in the Price. </li>
          <br>  
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Delivery of Goods</h4>
            <li> Delivery (“Delivery”) of the Goods is taken to occur at the time that: </li>
            <ol>
              <li> The Customer or the Customer’s nominated carrier takes possession of the Goods at MANLEC address; or </li>
              <li>MANLEC (or MANLEC nominated carrier) delivers the Goods to the Customer’s nominated address even if the Customer is not present at the address.</li>
          </ol>
          <li> At MANLEC sole discretion the cost of delivery is either included in the Price or is in addition to the Price.  </li>
          <li> Delivery of the Goods to a third party nominated by the Customer is deemed to be delivery to the Customer for the purposes of this agreement. </li>
          <li> The Customer must take delivery by receipt or collection of the Goods whenever either is tendered for delivery. In the event that the Customer is unable to take delivery of the Goods as arranged then MANLEC shall be entitled to charge a reasonable fee for redelivery of the Goods and/or the storage of the Goods. </li>
            <li> The Customer shall take delivery of the Goods tendered notwithstanding that the quantity so delivered shall be either greater or lesser  than the quantity purchased provided that: </li>
            <ol>
              <li> such discrepancy in quantity shall not exceed five percent (5%); and </li>
              <li> the Price shall be adjusted pro rata to the discrepancy. </li>
            </ol>
            <li> MANLEC may deliver the Goods in separate instalments. Each separate instalment shall be invoiced and paid in accordance with the provisions in these terms and conditions. </li>
            <li> Any time or date given by MANLEC to the Customer is an estimate only. The Customer must still accept delivery of the Goods even if   late and MANLEC will not be liable for any loss or damage incurred by the Customer as a result of the delivery being late. </li>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Risk</h4>
            <li> Risk of damage to or loss of the Goods passes to the Customer on Delivery and the Customer must insure the Goods on or before Delivery. </li>
            <li> If any of the Goods are damaged or destroyed following delivery but prior to ownership passing to the Customer, MANLEC is entitled to receive all insurance proceeds  payable for the Goods. The   production of these terms and conditions by MANLEC is sufficient evidence of MANLEC rights to receive the insurance proceeds without the need for any person dealing with MANLEC to make further enquiries. </li>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Access</h4>
            <li> The Customer shall ensure that MANLEC has clear and free access to the work site at all times to enable MANLEC to undertake the Electrical. MANLEC shall not be liable for any loss or damage to the site including without limitation, damage to pathways, driveways and concreted or paved or grassed areas. </li>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Dimensions, Plans and Specifications</h4>
            <li> All customary industry tolerances shall apply to the dimensions and measurements of the Goods unless MANLEC and the Customer agree otherwise in writing. MANLEC shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy of any plans, specifications and other information provided by the Customer. </li>
            <li> If the giving of an estimate or quotation for the supply of Goods involves MANLEC estimating measurements and quantities, it shall be the responsibility of the Customer to verify the accuracy of MANLEC estimated measurements and quantities, before the Customer places an order based on such estimate or accepts such quotation.</li>
            <li> Should the Customer require any changes to MANLEC estimated measurements and quantities, the Customer shall request such changes in writing. In the case of an estimate before placing an order and in the case of a quotation before acceptance. </li>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Customer’s Disclaimer</h4>
          <li>The Customer hereby disclaims any right to rescind, or cancel the contract or to sue for damages or to claim restitution arising out of any inadvertent misrepresentation made to the Customer by MANLEC and the Customer acknowledges that the Goods are bought relying solely upon the Customer’s skill and judgment. </li>
            <li>Where MANLEC provides advice to the Customer, such advice is given in good faith only. The Customer acknowledges that MANLEC shall not be liable for any claims howsoever arising out of any advice given. </li>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Electronic Transactions Act</h4>
            <li>Electronic signatures shall be deemed to be accepted  by  either party.</li>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Retention of Title to Goods</h4>
            <li>MANLEC and the Customer agree that ownership of the Goods shall not pass until: </li>
            <ol>
            <li>the Customer has paid MANLEC all amounts owing to MANLEC; and</li>
              <li> the Customer has met all of its other obligations to MANLEC. </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Receipt by MANLEC of any form of payment other than cash shall not be deemed to be payment until that form of payment has been honoured, cleared or recognised.</li>
            <li>It is further agreed that: </li>
            <ol>
              <li> until ownership of the Goods passes to the Customer in accordance with clause 11.1 that the Customer is only a bailee of the Goods and must return the Goods to MANLEC on request.</li> 
              <li> the Customer holds the benefit of the Customer’s insurance of the Goods on trust for MANLEC and must pay to MANLEC the proceeds of any insurance in the event of the Goods being lost, damaged or destroyed.</li>
              <li> the Customer must not sell, dispose, or otherwise part with possession of the Goods other than in the ordinary course of business and for market value. If the Customer sells, disposes or parts with possession of the Goods then the Customer must hold the proceeds of any such act on trust for MANLEC and must pay or deliver the proceeds to MANLEC on demand.</li>
              <li>the Customer should not convert or process the Goods or intermix them with other goods but if the Customer does so then the Customer holds the resulting product on trust for the benefit of MANLEC and must sell, dispose of or return the resulting product to MANLEC as it so directs.</li>
              <li>the Customer irrevocably authorises MANLEC to enter any premises where MANLEC believes the Goods are kept and recover possession of the goods.</li>
              <li>MANLEC may recover possession of any Goods in transit whether or not delivery has occurred.</li>
              <li>the Customer shall not charge or grant an encumbrance over the Goods nor grant nor otherwise give away any interest in the Goods while they remain the property of MANLEC.</li>
              <li>MANLEC may commence proceedings to recover the Price of the Goods sold notwithstanding that ownership of the Goods has not passed to the Customer.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (“PPSA”)</h4>
            <li> In this clause financing statement, financing change statement, security agreement, and security interest has the meaning given to it by the PPSA.</li>
            <li>Upon assenting to these terms and conditions in writing or act, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that these terms and conditions constitute a security agreement for the purposes of the PPSA and creates a security interest in Account, Goods and/or All Personal Property of the Grantor/Customer, including that has previously been supplied and that will be supplied in the future by MANLEC to the Customer.</li>
            <li>The Customer undertakes to: </li>
            <ol>
              <li> promptly sign any further documents and/or provide any further information (such information to be complete, accurate and up-to- date in all respects) which MANLEC may reasonably require to; </li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li> register   a   financing   statement   or   financing   change statement in relation to a security interest on the Personal Property Securities Register;</li>
              <li>register any other document required to be registered by the PPSA; or (iii) correct  a  defect  in  a  statement  referred  to  in  clause 12.3(a)(i) or 12.3(a)(ii); </li>
          </ol>
          <li>indemnify,  and  upon  demand  reimburse, MANLEC for all expenses incurred in registering a financing statement or financing change statement on the Personal Property Securities Register established by the PPSA or releasing any Goods charged thereby;</li>
          <li> not register a financing change statement in respect of a security interest without the prior written consent of MANLEC;</li>
          <li> not register, or permit to be registered, a financing statement or a financing change statement in relation to the Goods in favour of a third party without the prior written consent of MANLEC;</li>
          <li> immediately advise MANLEC of any material change in its business practices of selling Goods which would result in a change in the nature of proceeds derived from such sales. </li>
          </ol>
          <li>MANLEC and the Customer agree that sections 96, 115 and 125 of the PPSA do not apply to the security agreement created by these terms and conditions.</li> 
          <li>The Customer waives their rights to receive notices under sections 95, 118, 121(4), 130, 132(3) (d) and 132(4) of the PPSA.</li>
          <li>The Customer waives their rights as a grantor and/or a debtor under sections 142 and 143 of the PPSA.</li>
          <li>Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by MANLEC, the Customer waives their right to receive a verification statement in accordance with section 157 of the PPSA.</li>
          <li>The Customer must unconditionally ratify any actions taken by the MANLEC under clauses 12.3 to 12.7.</li>
          <li>Subject to any express provisions to the contrary nothing in these terms and conditions is intended to have the effect of contracting out of any of the provisions of the PPSA. </li>
          <br>
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Security and Charge</h4>
          <li> In consideration of MANLEC agreeing to supply the Works/Goods, the Customer charges all of its rights, title and interest (whether joint or several) in any land, reality or other assets capable of being charged, owned by the Customer either now or in the future, to secure the performance by the Customer of its obligations under these terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, the payment of any money).</li>
          <li>The Customer indemnifies MANLEC from and against all MANLEC costs   and disbursements including legal costs on a solicitor and own Customer basis incurred in exercising MANLEC rights under this clause.</li>
          <li>The Customer irrevocably appoints MANLEC and each director of MANLEC  as the Customer’s true and lawful attorney/s to perform all necessary acts to give effect to the provisions of this clause 13 including, but not limited to, signing any document on the Customer’s behalf. </li>
          <br>  
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold" >Defects, Warranties and Returns, Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA)</h4>
            <li>The Customer must inspect the Goods on delivery and must within thirty (30) days of delivery notify MANLEC in writing of any evident defect/damage, shortage in quantity, or failure to comply with the description or quote.</li>
            <li>The Customer must notify any other alleged defect in the Goods as soon as reasonably possible after any such defect becomes evident. Upon such notification the Customer must allow MANLEC to inspect the Goods. </li>
<li>Under applicable State, Territory and Commonwealth Law (including, without limitation the CCA), certain statutory implied guarantees and warranties (including, without limitation the statutory guarantees under the CCA) may be implied into these terms and conditions (Non-Excluded Guarantees).</li>
<li>MANLEC acknowledges that nothing in these terms and conditions purports to modify or exclude the Non-Excluded Guarantees.</li>
<li>Except as expressly set out in these terms and conditions in respect of the Non-Excluded Guarantees, MANLEC makes no Warranties or other representations under these terms and conditions including but not limited to the quality or suitability of the Goods. MANLEC liability in respect of these warranties is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
<li>If the Customer is a consumer within the meaning of the CCA, MANLEC liability is limited to the extent permitted by section 64A of Schedule 2.</li>
<li>If MANLEC is required to replace the Goods under this clause or the CCA, but is unable to do so, MANLEC may refund any money the Customer has paid for the Goods.</li>
<li> If the Customer is not a consumer within the meaning of the CCA, MANLEC liability for any defect or damage in the Goods is:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>limited to the value of any express warranty or warranty card provided  to  the  Customer  by  MANLEC   at  the  MANLEC sole discretion;</li>
      <li>limited to any warranty to which MANLEC  is entitled, if MANLEC  did not manufacture the Goods;</li>
      <li>otherwise negated absolutely. </li>
          </ol>    
          <li>Subject to this clause 14, returns will only be accepted provided that: </li>
          <ol>
            <li>The Customer has complied with the provisions of clause 14.1; and</li>
            <li>MANLEC has agreed that the Goods are defective; and</li>
            <li>the Goods are returned within a reasonable time at the Customer’s cost (if that cost is not significant); and</li>
            <li>the Goods are returned in as close a condition to that in which they were delivered as is possible. </li>
          </ol>
          <li>Notwithstanding clauses 14.1 to 14.8 but subject to the CCA, MANLEC shall not be liable for any defect or damage which may be caused or partly caused by or arise as a result of: </li>
            <ol>
